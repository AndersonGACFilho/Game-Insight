# Game Insight üéÆ
Game Insight is a cross-platform game recommendation engine designed to answer the perennial gamer question: **"What should I play next?"**

It solves this by creating a **"True Gamer Profile"**‚Äîa single, unified view of a user's entire gaming life, aggregating library data, playtime, and achievements from multiple platforms like Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. This rich, behavioral dataset powers a nuanced recommendation engine that goes far beyond simple genre matching.

-----

## Key Features

  - **Unified Game Library**: Connect multiple platform accounts to see your entire collection in one place.
  - **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**: A sophisticated model combining content-based and collaborative filtering to give you tailored suggestions.
  - **Deep Data Analysis**: Leverages nuanced metrics like **playtime** and **achievements** to understand your unique playstyle.
  - **Integrated Deal Tracking**: Get alerts when games on your wishlist go on sale across various storefronts.
  - **Cross-Platform Clients**: Access your profile and recommendations via a web app (React) and a mobile app (React Native).

## System Architecture

The platform is built on a modern, scalable microservices architecture to ensure performance and separation of concerns.

### Technology Stack

  * **Frontend**: React (Web), React Native (Mobile)
  * **API Gateway & ETLs**: Go (Golang)
  * **Backend Core Services**: Java (Spring Boot)
  * **Recommendation Service**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
  * **Database**: PostgreSQL
  * **Asynchronous Messaging**: RabbitMQ (for inter-service commands), Apache Kafka (for data ingestion pipelines)

### System Utilization Flow

This diagram illustrates how clients interact with the backend services through the API Gateway.

## Project Roadmap

The project is being developed according to a strategic, phased roadmap.

  * **Phase 1: De-Risking & Foundation üèõÔ∏è**

      * **Goal**: Achieve legal and technical stability.
      * **Focus**: Build a functional MVP using only the official Steam API while proactively initiating formal partnership discussions with Sony and Microsoft for legitimate data access.

  * **Phase 2: Expansion & Growth üöÄ**

      * **Goal**: Achieve product-market fit and scale the user base.
      * **Focus**: Integrate console data (upon securing partnerships), launch publicly with a freemium subscription model, and activate deal tracking features.

  * **Phase 3: Moat-Building & Scaling üè∞**

      * **Goal**: Create a defensible market position and activate long-term revenue streams.
      * **Focus**: Build social features to drive network effects and develop a B2B data insights product for publishers and developers.
