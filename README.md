# Game Insight ðŸŽ®
Game Insight is a cross-platform game recommendation engine designed to answer the perennial gamer question: **"What should I play next?"**

It solves this by creating a **"True Gamer Profile"**â€”a single, unified view of a user's entire gaming life, aggregating library data, playtime, and achievements from multiple platforms like Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. This rich, behavioral dataset powers a nuanced recommendation engine that goes far beyond simple genre matching.

> Project Status: v0.1.0 â€“ Initial public documentation and early architecture phase (pre-public MVP). Steam-only MVP in progress; console integrations pending official partnerships.

## Overview
Game Insight unifies fragmented gaming activity into a behavioral profile used to deliver high-quality, explainable recommendations plus real-time deal intelligence. Short-term focus: Steam-only MVP validating retention + recommendation engagement. Medium-term: secure official console data partnerships. Long-term: social/network effects and anonymized B2B insights. Canonical terminology lives in `docs/glossary.md`.

## Key Features

- **Unified Game Library**: Connect multiple platform accounts to see your entire collection in one place.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for tailored suggestions.
- **Deep Data Analysis**: Leverages nuanced metrics like **playtime** and **achievements** to understand playstyle.
- **Integrated Deal Tracking**: Alerts when wishlist games go on sale across storefronts.
- **Cross-Platform Clients**: Web (React) and Mobile (React Native).
- **Privacy & Governance (Planned)**: Explicit consent flows, transparent data usage, opt-out pipelines.

> Implementation Strategy: Start lean. A simplified single-process deployment (gateway + core logic + basic rec stub) can be used initially before decomposing into full microservices as scale and complexity justify it.

---

## System Architecture

A modern, polyglot microservices architecture for scalability and separation of concerns.

**Stack Overview**
- **Frontend**: React (Web), React Native (Mobile)
- **API Gateway & ETLs**: Go
- **Core Services**: Java (Spring Boot)
- **Recommendation Service**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ (commands) & Apache Kafka (ingestion)

Detailed diagrams and rationale: `./docs/architecture/strategic-analysis.md`.

[ Clients ] -> [ API Gateway (Go) ] -> [ User Svc | Game Svc (Java) ] -> [ Rec Svc (Py) ]

## Project Roadmap (High-Level)

| Phase | Focus | Core Outcomes |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1. De-Risking & Foundation | Steam-only MVP, legal/privacy readiness | Steam ingest, core services, onboarding quiz |
| 2. Expansion & Growth | Console integrations (if licensed), freemium launch | Cross-platform rec engine v1, deal alerts, subscriptions |
| 3. Moat & Scaling | Social + B2B data products | Network effects, analytics dashboards, insights offering |

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running for development and testing:

### Prerequisites
Install:
- Git
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (v18+)
- Go (v1.20+)
- Java (JDK 17+)
- Python (3.9+)

### Installation
1. Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AndersonGACFilho/Game-Insight.git
cd Game-Insight
```
2. Copy env template & configure
```sh
cp example.env .env
```
3. Start services (when compose file available)
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
4. (Optional) Run only web client (placeholder until structure is added)
```sh
cd web && npm install && npm start
```

## Environment Variables
(Adjust as services are created.)

| Variable | Description                | Example |
|----------|----------------------------|---------|
| STEAM_API_KEY | Steam Web API key          | abc123... |
| DATABASE_URL | Postgres connection string | postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/game_insight |
| KAFKA_BROKERS | Kafka bootstrap servers    | localhost:9092 |
| RABBITMQ_URL | RabbitMQ connection URL    | amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/ |
| JWT_SECRET | Token signing secret       | (generated) |
| DEALS_API_KEY | IsThereAnyDeal key         | keyvalue |
| LOG_LEVEL | Global log verbosity       | info |

> Principle: store no secrets in code; prefer Docker secrets / vault in production.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Branching**: `main` (stable), feature branches: `feat/<scope>`, fixes: `fix/<scope>`.
2. **Commits**: Prefer Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.).
3. **Code Style**: Add linters/formatters per language (planned): ESLint + Prettier, `gofmt`, `spotless` for Java, `black` for Python.
4. **Testing**: (Placeholder) Add minimal tests earlyâ€”especially for rec engine evaluation metrics.
5. **CI/CD**: Planned pipeline stages: build â†’ lint â†’ unit tests â†’ security scan â†’ package â†’ deploy.
6. **Security**: No production credentials in `.env`. Rotate API keys quarterly.
7. **Observability (Planned)**: Centralized logging, tracing (OpenTelemetry), metrics dashboards (Grafana).
